In this repository we include a number of supplementary materials that accompany our [VCBM conference paper](https://vis.uib.no/wp-content/papercite-data/pdfs/Garrison-2021-EPP.pdf) to provide additional information for anyone interested. We've organized these materials as follows:
1. [Supplementary material details](1-survey_supplementary_details.pdf). 
This document serves as a primary supplement
to our work. Here we provide interested readers a deeper layer of topic-specific details on (1)
asset scores, (2) attribute rankings, and (3) keywords.
2. [Survey visual assets](2-assets/).
This directory contains all source assets that we created for our study. Assets are organized
into sub-directories by topic, and named according to their labels shown in Figs. 1 and 4 of the
manuscript, e.g., choice1, choice2, etc. This may be useful particularly to view the animated assets
(GIFs).
3. [Per-topic Tableau visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/profile/biomedsurvey2021). 
A clear visual summary of our results per-topic on Tableau Public
4. [Survey result raw data](3-results.xlsx). 
This spreadsheet contains the results of our survey, and was the input to the per-topic result visualizations
available on [**Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/biomedsurvey2021)
